# ECEN-4013-Design-of-Eng-Systems-Fa24 Senior Design Project 1
## Authors: Brent Bertaux, Jacob Erwin, Katilynn Mar, Johnny Williamson

A 4-bit successive approximation A to D converter was designed for this project 
Major elements include:
• Sample/hold amplifier (S/H)
• D/A converter
• Comparator (Schmitt trigger recommended)
• Storage register
• Clock
• Control and sequencing logic

(1)Initiate a conversion sequence on
command
(2)Present a digital parallel 4-bit conversion
result (nibble) when data ready.
Initial Specifications: Project #1
3. Have an input range of 0-5 VDC.
4. Have a data conversion of at least 100
samples/second (sps). Conversion rate in
excess of 1 ksps is desired.
5. No missing codes.Initial Specifications: Project #1

(6) Have a unipolar power source or bipolar supply
connections from bench power supply.
(7) Have an adequate associated test plan in which
all tests pass.
You have a budget of
$100 for parts that cannot be found in the part store.
